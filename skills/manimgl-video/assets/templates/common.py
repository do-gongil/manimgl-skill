"""Shared helpers for every scene file in this project. `from common import *`.

Two decisions made once instead of once per label:

- Pango substitutes a missing font silently, so the font is named explicitly
  and per platform. Change FONT if the on-screen language changes.
- manimlib's `Tex` wraps content in `align*`, which needs amsmath. The
  `empty_ctex` template (required on MiKTeX) has an empty preamble, so the
  packages are injected per call. Harmless on TeX Live.
